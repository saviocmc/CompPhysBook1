@article{akmal98,
	Abstract = {Properties of dense nucleon matter and the structure of neutron stars
	are studied using variational chain summation methods and the new
	Argonne v18 two-nucleon interaction, which provides an excellent
	fit to all of the nucleon-nucleon scattering data in the Nijmegen
	database. The neutron star gravitational mass limit obtained with
	this interaction is 1.67M?. Boost corrections to the two-nucleon
	interaction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order
	(v/c)2, as well as three-nucleon interactions, are also included
	in the nuclear Hamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the
	mass limit to 1.80 and 2.20 M?. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon
	interaction predict a transition in neutron star matter to a phase
	with neutral pion condensation at a baryon number density of ?0.2?fm-3.
	Neutron stars predicted by these Hamiltonians have a layer with a
	thickness on the order of tens of meters, over which the density
	changes rapidly from that of the normal to the condensed phase. The
	material in this thin layer is a mixture of the two phases. We also
	investigate the possibility of dense nucleon matter having an admixture
	of quark matter, described using the bag model equation of state.
	Neutron stars of 1.4M? do not appear to have quark matter admixtures
	in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are predicted to have
	cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These admixtures
	reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91)
	M? for bag constant B=200?(122)?MeV/fm3. Stars with pure quark matter
	in their cores are found to be unstable. We also consider the possibility
	that matter is maximally incompressible above an assumed density,
	and show that realistic models of nuclear forces limit the maximum
	mass of neutron stars to be below 2.5M?. The effects of the phase
	transitions on the composition of neutron star matter and its adiabatic
	index ? are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A quantum dot is a sub-micron-scale conducting device containing up
	to several thousand electrons.Transport through a quantum dot at
	low temperatures is a quantum-coherent process. This review focuses
	on dots in which the electron{\^a}s dynamics are chaotic or diffusive,
	giving rise to statistical properties that reflect the interplay
	between one-body chaos, quantum interference, and electron-electron
	interactions. The conductance through such dots displays mesoscopic
	fluctuations as a function of gate voltage, magnetic field, and shape
	deformation. The techniques used to describe these fluctuations include
	semiclassical methods, random-matrix theory, and the supersymmetric
	nonlinear s model. In open dots, the approximation of noninteracting
	quasiparticles is justified, and electron-electron interactions contribute
	indirectly through their effect on the dephasing time at finite temperature.
	In almost-closed dots, where conductance occurs by tunneling, the
	charge on the dot is quantized, and electron-electron interactions
	play an important role. Transport is dominated by Coulomb blockade,
	leading to peaks in the conductance that at low temperatures provide
	information on the dot{\^a}s ground-state properties. Several statistical
	signatures of electron-electron interactions have been identified,
	most notably in the dot{\^a}s addition spectrum. The dot{\^a}s spin,
	determined partly by exchange interactions, can also influence the
	fluctuation properties of the conductance. Other mesoscopic phenomena
	in quantum dots that are affected by the charging energy include
	the fluctuations of the cotunneling conductance and mesoscopic Coulomb
	blockade. },

	Abstract = {The Qweak experiment has measured the parity-violating asymmetry in
	e⃗p elastic scattering at Q2=0.025 (GeV/c)2, employing 145  μA of
	89% longitudinally polarized electrons on a 34.4 cm long liquid hydrogen
	target at Jefferson Lab. The results of the experiment's commissioning
	run, constituting approximately 4% of the data collected in the experiment,
	are reported here. From these initial results, the measured asymmetry
	is Aep=-279$\pm$35 (stat) $\pm$ 31 (syst) ppb, which is the smallest and
	most precise asymmetry ever measured in e⃗p scattering. The small
	Q2 of this experiment has made possible the first determination of
	the weak charge of the proton QWp by incorporating earlier parity-violating
	electron scattering (PVES) data at higher Q2 to constrain hadronic
	corrections. The value of QWp obtained in this way is QWp(PVES)=0.064$\pm$0.012,
	which is in good agreement with the standard model prediction of
	QWp(SM)=0.0710$\pm$0.0007. When this result is further combined with
	the Cs atomic parity violation (APV) measurement, significant constraints
	on the weak charges of the up and down quarks can also be extracted.
	That PVES+APV analysis reveals the neutron's weak charge to be QWn(PVES+APV)=-0.975$\pm$0.010.},

	surprisingly large values relative to standard shell model predictions,
	generating an unexpected asymmetry in the B(E2) values with respect
	to the neutron midshell. This effect has triggered various speculations
	as to its origin, such as a possible weakening of the N,Z=50 shell

	the origin of the observed asymmetric character of the B(E2) values

	effects may play an important role near the N=50 shell closure. A
	new set of single-particle energies and monopole interactions, fitted
	to the experimental data in the region, together with the isospin-dependent
	effective charge suggested by Bohr and Mottelson is shown to reproduce

	Abstract = {A central issue in the theory of astrophysical compact objects and
	heavy-ion reactions at intermediate and relativistic energies is
	the nuclear equation of state (EoS). On the one hand, the large and
	expanding set of experimental and observational data is expected
	to constrain the behaviour of the nuclear EoS, especially at density
	above saturation, where it is directly linked to fundamental processes
	which can occur in dense matter. On the other hand, theoretical predictions
	for the EoS at high density can be challenged by the phenomenological
	findings. In this topical review paper, we present the many-body
	theory of nuclear matter as developed along different years and with
	different methods. Only nucleonic degrees of freedom are considered.
	We compare the different methods at a formal level, as well as the
	final EoS calculated within each one of the considered many-body
	schemes. The outcome of this analysis should help in restricting
	the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions for the nuclear EoS.},

	Abstract = {Recent results obtained by applying the method of self-consistent
	Green?s functions to nuclei and nuclear matter are reviewed. Particular
	attention is given to the description of experimental data obtained
	from the (e,e?p) and (e,e?2N) reactions that determine one- and two-nucleon
	removal probabilities in nuclei since the corresponding amplitudes
	are directly related to the imaginary parts of the single-particle
	and two-particle propagators. For this reason and the fact that these
	amplitudes can now be calculated with the inclusion of all the relevant
	physical processes, it is useful to explore the efficacy of the method
	of self-consistent Green?s functions in describing these experimental
	data. Results for both finite nuclei and nuclear matter are discussed
	with particular emphasis on clarifying the role of short-range correlations
	in determining various experimental quantities. The important role
	of long-range correlations in determining the structure of low-energy
	correlations is also documented. For a complete understanding of
	nuclear phenomena it is therefore essential to include both types
	of physical correlations. We demonstrate that recent experimental
	results for these reactions combined with the reported theoretical
	calculations yield a very clear understanding of the properties of
	all protons in the nucleus. We propose that this knowledge of the
	properties of constituent fermions in a correlated many-body system
	is a unique feature of nuclear physics.},

	have been presented earlier. As expected, we find similar results
	for the two distributions, namely a nonzero Tc but evidence that
	d=3 is close to the lower critical dimension. In a four-dimensional
	spin glass with Gaussian bonds we find that only a modest amount

	Abstract = {The Goldstone expansion is rederived by elementary time-independent
	methods, starting from Brillouin-Wigner (BW) perturbation theory.
	Interaction energy terms $\delta $E are expanded out of the BW energy
	denominators, and the series is then rearranged to obtain the linked-cluster
	result. Similar algebraic methods lead to the linked expansions for
	the total wave function (Hugenholtz) and the expectation value of
	a general operator (Thouless). Starting again with a degenerate version
	of BW perturbation theory, these methods are used to obtain the Bloch-Horowitz
	energy expansion, as well as the corresponding wave function, expectation-value,
	and transition-amplitude expansions. A "reduced" form of the Block-Horowitz
	expansion is described, and also a "completely linked" version. The
	latter is suggested as a tool for investigating superfiuid phenomena
	in nuclear matter, and for establishing contact with the Landau theory
	of Fermi liquids. The physical interpretation of these expansions
	is carefully studied, especially with regard to nuclear applications,
	to determine how they handle such "physical" features as antisymmetry,
	self-energy effects, wave-function renormalizations, and the distinction
	between "true" and "model" single-particle occupation probabilities.
	The problem of a correct theoretical definition for the shell-model
	potential is carefully examined, and a specific theory is presented.
	These expansions are seen to form a convenient and very powerful

	the exact nature of the electronic states. The electrostatic potential

	Hamiltonian then determines the states of the electrons in the dot
	within the effective-mass approximation. The screening due to the
	gate electrodes is also taken into account. This method may be used
	for a range of device geometries, but here we calculate the low-lying
	levels of a cylindrically symmetric, electrostatically confined quantum
	dot to better than 0.1%. Results for the ground-state energy and

	coefficient (ANC). We evaluate the extraction of a SF from the ratio
	of the ANC of the coupled-channel model to that of a single-particle
	approximation of the wave function. We perform this study within
	a core+n collective model, which includes two states of the core
	that connect by a rotational coupling. To get additional insights,
	we also use a simplified model that takes a δ function for the coupling
	potential. Calculations are performed for 11Be. Fair agreement is
	obtained between the SF inferred from the single-particle approximation
	and the one obtained within the coupled-channel models. Significant
	discrepancies are observed only for large coupling strength and/or
	large admixture, that is, a small SF. This suggests that reliable

	Abstract = {The first excited 2+ state of the unstable isotope 110Sn has been
	studied in safe Coulomb excitation at 2.82 MeV/u using the MINIBALL
	array at the REX-ISOLDE post accelerator at CERN. This is the first
	measurement of the reduced transition probability of this state using
	this method for a neutron deficient Sn isotope. The strength of the
	approach lies in the excellent peak-to-background ratio that is achieved.
	The extracted reduced transition probability, B(E2:0+-->2+)=0.220$\pm$0.022e2b2,
	strengthens the observation of the evolution of the B(E2) values
	of neutron deficient Sn isotopes that was observed recently in intermediate-energy
	Coulomb excitation of 108Sn. It implies that the trend of these reduced
	transition probabilities in the even-even Sn isotopes is not symmetric
	with respect to the midshell mass number A=116 as 100Sn is approached.},

	Abstract = {In the last few years, the low-momentum nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction
	Vlow-k derived from free-space NN potentials has been successfully
	used in shell-model calculations. Vlow-k is a smooth potential which
	preserves the deuteron binding energy as well as the half-on-shell
	T matrix of the original NN potential up to a momentum cutoff Lambda.
	In this paper, we test a new low-momentum NN potential derived from
	chiral perturbation theory at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order
	with a sharp low-momentum cutoff at 2.1 fm-1. Shell-model calculations
	for the oxygen isotopes using effective Hamiltonians derived from
	both types of low-momentum potential are performed. We find that
	the two potentials show the same perturbative behavior and yield
	very similar results.},

	The 2.87-MeV/u radioactive beam was produced at the REX-ISOLDE facility

	Abstract = {The use of exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models to describe the
	physics of systems with strong pair correlations is reviewed. The
	article begins with a brief discussion of Richardson's early work,
	which demonstrated the exact solvability of the pure pairing model,
	and then shows how that work has evolved recently into a much richer
	class of exactly solvable models. The Richardson solution leads naturally
	to an exact analogy between these quantum models and classical electrostatic
	problems in two dimensions. This analogy is then used to demonstrate
	formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit of the pure
	pairing Hamiltonian. Several applications to problems of relevance
	to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of
	confined systems are considered. Some of the interesting effects
	that are discussed in the context of these exactly solvable models
	include (i) the crossover from superconductivity to a fluctuation-dominated
	regime in small metallic grains; (ii) the role of the nucleon Pauli
	principle in suppressing the effects of high-spin bosons in interacting
	boson models of nuclei, and (iii) the possibility of fragmentation
	in confined boson systems. Interesting insight is also provided into
	the origin of the superconducting phase transition both in two-dimensional
	electronic systems and in atomic nuclei, based on the electrostatic
	image of the corresponding exactly solvable quantum pairing models.},

	Abstract = {A further study of the degeneracy of the two dimensional harmonic
	oscillator is made, both in the isotropic and anisotropic cases.
	By regarding the Hamiltonian as a linear operator acting through
	the Poisson bracket on functions of the coordinates and momenta,
	a method applicable generally to bilinear Hamiltonians, it is shown
	how all possible rational constants of the motion may be generated.
	They are formed from eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian which are
	linear combinations of the coordinates and momenta, and which belong
	to negative pairs of eigenvalues. Canonical coordinates, which may
	be visualized geometrically for the isotropic oscillator in terms
	of the Hopf mapping, place the symmetry group responsible for the
	accidental degeneracy clearly in evidence. Surprisingly, one finds
	that the unitary unimodular group SU2, is the symmetry group in all
	cases, even including that of an anisotropic oscillator with incommensurable
	frequencies. The lack of a quantum-mechanical analogy in the latter
	case is due to a lack of the necessary transcendental roots of the
	operators involved in attempting to use the correspondence principle,
	rather than to the lack of a symmetry group for the classical problem.},

	each employing the Kohn?Sham Hamiltonian as the unperturbed system.
	Using accurate exchange-correlation potentials generated from essentially
	exact densities and their exchange components determined by a recently
	proposed method, we evaluate energy differences between the ground
	state and excited states in first-order perturbation theory for the
	helium, ionized lithium and beryllium atoms. It was recently observed
	that the zeroth-order excitations energies, simply given by the difference
	of the Kohn?Sham eigenvalues, almost always lie between the singlet
	and triplet experimental excitations energies, corrected for relativistic
	and finite nuclear mass effects. The first-order corrections provide
	about a factor of two improvement in one of the perturbative schemes
	but not in the other. The excitation energies within perturbation
	theory are found to be more accurate than the excitations obtained
	within DeltaSCF while, for a two-electron system, they coincide with
	the ones obtained in time-dependent density functional theory within
	the single-pole approximation using our accurate static exchange-correlation
	potential and the time-dependent optimized effective potential kernel.
	We find that the agreement between the experimental and the perturbative
	excitation energies deteriorates significantly if potentials from
	approximate functionals such as the local density approximation and
	the optimized effective potential method are employed instead of
	the true Kohn?Sham potential.},

	Abstract = {We consider a model, given by two interacting electrons in an external
	harmonic potential, that can be solved analytically for a discrete
	and infinite set of values of the spring constant. The knowledge
	of the exact electronic density allows us to construct the exact
	exchange?correlation potential and exchange?correlation energy by
	inverting the Kohn?Sham equation. The exact exchange?correlation
	potential and energy are compared with the corresponding quantities,
	obtained for the same densities, using approximate density functionals,
	namely the local density approximation and several generalized gradient
	approximations. We consider two values of the spring constant in
	order to study the system in the low correlation case (high value
	of the spring constant) and in the high correlation case (low value
	of the spring constant). In both cases, the exchange?correlation
	potentials corresponding to approximate density functionals differ
	from the exact one over the entire spatial range. The approximate
	correlation potentials bear no resemblance to the exact ones. The
	exchange energy for generalized gradient approximation functionals
	is much improved compared to the result obtained within the local
	density approximation but the correlation energy is only a little
	improved.},

	Abstract = {We explore the errors in the free energy and in operator expectation
	values when the quantum operator e-?H=?l=1Le-(??)H is approximated
	by ?l=1Lf, where ??=?/L and f is an approximant to e-(??)H. We determine
	analytically the dependence of the resulting errors on ?? for ??
	small, on ? for ? large, and on the size of the system in the limit
	of a large system. We focus on Trotter approximations, as well as
	on the expansion of e-(??)H in powers of (??)H. Our results are particularly
	relevant to Monte Carlo studies of quantum systems, and can be used
	effectively to eliminate the error due to Trotter-like approximations
	and to provide a guide for choosing a particular type of approximation.},

	Abstract = {A generalized contour deformation method (CDM), which combines complex
	rotation and translation in momentum space, is discussed. CDM gives
	accurate calculation of two-body spectral structures: bound, antibound,
	resonant and continuum states forming a Berggren basis. It provides
	a basis for full off-shell t-matrix calculations both for real and
	complex input energies. Results for both spectral structures and
	scattering amplitudes compare perfectly well with exact values for
	the analytically solvable separable non-local Yamaguchi potential
	as a testcase. Accurate calculation of antibound states in the Malfliet-Tjon
	and the realistic CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential are presented.
	Calculation of antibound states in the CD-Bonn potential are not
	known to have been given elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {We study a model of asymptotically free theories with bound states
	using the similarity renormalization group for Hamiltonians. We find
	that the renormalized effective Hamiltonians can be approximated

	the running coupling constant. This approximation loses accuracy
	for the small widths on the order of the bound state energy and it
	is improved by using the expansion in powers of the running coupling
	constant. The coupling constant for small widths is of order 1. The
	small width effective Hamiltonian is projected on a small subset
	of the effective basis states. The resulting small matrix is diagonalized
	exactly and the bound state energy of the original theory is obtained
	with accuracy of the order of 10% using the first three terms in
	the perturbative expansion of the effective Hamiltonian. We briefly

@article{taut2007,
	Abstract = {We report on analytical and numerical studies of the magnetic quantum
	oscillations?the de Haas?van Alphen (dHvA) effect?in a model of spinless
	electrons on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice in a magnetic
	field B known as the Azbel-Hofstadter (AH) problem. The numerical
	simulations of the dHvA oscillations are based on the magnetic band
	structure, which is obtained by numerical diagonalization of the
	one-electron model Hamiltonian on a square lattice in the magnetic
	field. At zero magnetic field and for a filling of 0.55 electrons
	per unit cell, the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) is close to a
	chessboard in which white and black cells are related to holes and
	electrons, respectively. The numerical simulations of the dHvA oscillations
	for this FS clearly display the magnetic breakdown (MB) features
	in the Fourier spectrum: the combinational and forbidden frequencies,
	which cannot be explained within the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich theory.
	Because of the idealized conditions of our numerical simulation (zero
	temperature, ideal crystal lattice) the only reason for deviation
	of the dHvA oscillations from the sawtooth magnetization of a 2D
	electron gas is the fractal magnetic band structure of the AH problem.
	We have also developed a semiclassical analytical approach to the
	dHvA oscillations taking account of the MB at the corners of the
	hole and electron orbits of the FS, the probability of which 0<=W(B)=exp(?BMB/B)<=1
	depends on B and the MB field BMB. We have shown that the dHvA oscillations
	in this case are completely determined by the quantization of the
	closed hole and electron orbits and by special MB factors for these
	orbits Ie(h)(p) (p=1,2,3,..., is the harmonic index). The factors
	Ie(h)(p) not only strongly modulate the amplitudes of harmonics in
	the magnetization but act also through the changes in the chemical
	potential (CP) oscillations. The latter are very important: they
	control the shape of the magnetization (which can be close either
	to a direct or an inverted sawtoothlike profile) and add forbidden
	peaks in the Fourier spectrum. In the case of a fixed CP the forbidden
	peaks vanish and the magnetization profile is close to the direct
	sawtooth. As a function of the MB probability W(B), the MB factors
	Ie(h)(p) are polynomials of degree p with the following fixed values
	at the ends: 1 at W(B)=0 and 0 at W(B)=1. Our analytic expression
	for the magnetization as a function of magnetic field B agrees pretty
	well with our numerical simulations using only one fitting parameter?the
	MB field BMB. Small deviations are due to the fractal fine structure
	of the magnetic bands.},

@article{PRC89nmatter,
	Abstract = {Background: The equation of state (EoS) of nucleonic matter is central
	for the understanding of bulk nuclear properties, the physics of
	neutron star crusts, and the energy release in supernova explosions.
	Because nuclear matter exhibits a finely tuned saturation point,
	its EoS also constrains nuclear interactions.
	
	Purpose: This work presents coupled-cluster calculations of infinite
	nucleonic matter using modern interactions from chiral effective
	field theory (EFT). It assesses the role of correlations beyond particle-particle
	and hole-hole ladders, and the role of three-nucleon forces (3NFs)
	in nuclear matter calculations with chiral interactions.
	
	Methods: This work employs the optimized nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential
	NNLOopt at next-to-next-to leading order, and presents coupled-cluster
	computations of the EoS for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron
	matter. The coupled-cluster method employs up to selected triples
	clusters and the single-particle space consists of a momentum-space
	lattice. We compare our results with benchmark calculations and control
	finite-size effects and shell oscillations via twist-averaged boundary
	conditions.
	
	Results: We provide several benchmarks to validate the formalism and
	show that our results exhibit a good convergence toward the thermodynamic
	limit. Our calculations agree well with recent coupled-cluster results
	based on a partial wave expansion and particle-particle and hole-hole
	ladders. For neutron matter at low densities, and for simple potential
	models, our calculations agree with results from quantum Monte Carlo
	computations. While neutron matter with interactions from chiral
	EFT is perturbative, symmetric nuclear matter requires nonperturbative
	approaches. Correlations beyond the standard particle-particle ladder
	approximation yield non-negligible contributions. The saturation
	point of symmetric nuclear matter is sensitive to the employed 3NFs
	and the employed regularization scheme. 3NFs with nonlocal cutoffs
	exhibit a considerably improved convergence than their local cousins.
	We are unable to find values for the parameters of the short-range
	part of the local 3NF that simultaneously yield acceptable values
	for the saturation point in symmetric nuclear matter and the binding
	energies of light nuclei.
	
	Conclusions: Coupled-cluster calculations with nuclear interactions
	from chiral EFT yield nonperturbative results for the EoS of nucleonic
	matter. Finite-size effects and effects of truncations can be controlled.
	For the optimization of chiral forces, it might be useful to include
	the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter.},

	and frequency-dependent polarizabilities of Ne and ethylene, as well
	as for the static polarizabilities of HF. The largest calculation
	employs the t-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set for ethylene giving a total of
	328 basis functions. The results obtained agree well with the experimental

@article{haxton:034005,
	Abstract = {I explore the form of the effective interaction in harmonic-oscillator-based
	effective theory (HOBET) in leading order (LO) through next-to-next-to-next-to-leading
	order (N3LO). Because the included space in a HOBET (as in the shell
	model) is defined by the oscillator energy, both long-distance (low-momentum)
	and short-distance (high-momentum) degrees of freedom reside in the
	high-energy excluded space. A HOBET effective interaction is developed
	in which a short-range contact-gradient expansion, free of operator
	mixing and corresponding to a systematic expansion in nodal quantum
	numbers, is combined with an exact summation of the relative kinetic
	energy. By this means the very strong coupling of the included (P)
	and excluded (Q) spaces by the kinetic energy is removed. One finds
	a simple and rather surprising result, that the interplay of QT and
	QV is governed by a single parameter kappa, the ratio of an observable,
	the binding energy |E|, to a parameter in the effective theory, the
	oscillator energy [h-bar]omega. Once the functional dependence on
	kappa is identified, the remaining order-by-order subtraction of
	the short-range physics residing in Q becomes systematic and rapidly
	converging. Numerical calculations are used to demonstrate how well
	the resulting expansion reproduces the running of Heff from high
	scales to a typical shell-model scale of 8[h-bar]omega. At N3LO various
	global properties of Heff are reproduced to a typical accuracy of
	0.01%, or about 1 keV, at 8[h-bar]omega. Channel-by-channel variations
	in convergence rates are similar to those found in effective field
	theory approaches. The state dependence of the effective interaction
	has been a troubling problem in nuclear physics and is embodied in
	the energy dependence of Heff(|E|) in the Bloch-Horowitz formalism.
	It is shown that almost all of this state dependence is also extracted
	in the procedures followed here, isolated in the analytic dependence
	of Heff on kappa. Thus there exists a simple, Hermitian Heff that
	can be use in spectral calculations. The existence of a systematic
	operator expansion for Heff, depending on a series of short-range
	constants augmented by kappa, will be important to future efforts
	to determine the HOBET interaction directly from experiment, rather
	than from an underlying NN potential.},

	Our many-body description starts with the most recent meson-exchange

	which in turn is used in our perturbative schemes to evaluate the
	effective interaction for finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter.
	A unified perturbative approach based on time-dependent perturbation

	the first time in a proton knockout reaction from a 26F beam. A single

	to a neutron decay energy of 770<sub>-10</sub><sup>+20</sup> keV
	with a total width of 172(30) keV. The N=16 shell gap was established
	to be 4.86(13) MeV by the energy difference between the nu1s1/2 and
	nu0d3/2 orbitals. The neutron separation energies for 25O agree with
	the calculations of the universal sd shell model interaction. This
	interaction incorrectly predicts an 26O ground state that is bound
	to two-neutron decay by 1 MeV, leading to a discrepancy between the

	Abstract = {It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena
	in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of
	the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation
	a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow
	energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock
	approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function
	technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for
	this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing
	to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the
	ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition
	for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the
	physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

	Abstract = {Double eigenvalues are not generic for matrices without any particular
	structure. A matrix depending linearly on a scalar parameter, A+μB,
	will, however, generically have double eigenvalues for some values
	of the parameter μ. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding
	those values. More precisely, we construct a method to accurately
	find all scalar pairs (λ,μ) such that A+μB has a double eigenvalue
	λ, where A and B are given arbitrary complex matrices. The general
	idea of the globally convergent method is that if μ is close to a
	solution, then A+μB has two eigenvalues which are close to each other.
	We fix the relative distance between these two eigenvalues and construct
	a method to solve and study it by observing that the resulting problem
	can be stated as a two-parameter eigenvalue problem, which is already
	studied in the literature. The method, which we call the method of
	fixed relative distance (MFRD), involves solving a two-parameter
	eigenvalue problem which returns approximations of all solutions.
	It is unfortunately not possible to get full accuracy with MFRD.
	In order to compute solutions with full accuracy, we present an iterative
	method which returns a very accurate solution, for a sufficiently
	good starting value. The approach is illustrated with one academic
	example and one application to a simple problem in computational
	quantum mechanics.},

	The equations are solved in the Hartree approximation, omitting exchange
	and correlation effects. Potential profiles, energy levels, and the
	charge in the quantum dot are obtained as functions of the applied
	gate voltage and magnetic field. First, the zero-magnetic-field case
	is considered, and the quantum-dot charge is allowed to vary continuously
	as the gate voltage is swept. Then, in connection with the phenomenon
	of Coulomb blockade, the number of electrons in the quantum dot is
	constrained to integer values. Finally, the calculation is extended
	to examine the evolution of levels in a magnetic field applied perpendicular
	to the heterojunction. Our results indicate that the confining potential
	has nearly circular symmetry despite the square geometry of the gate,
	that the energy levels are quite insensitive to the charge in the
	quantum dot at a fixed gate voltage, and that the evolution of levels
	with increasing magnetic field is similar to that found for a parabolic
	potential.},

	Abstract = {We consider the solution of the one-dimensional Schr{\"\i}¿½dinger problem
	over an infinite integration interval. The infinite problem is regularized
	by truncating the integration interval and imposing the appropriate
	boundary conditions at the truncation points. The Schr{\"\i}¿½dinger problem
	is then solved on the truncated integration interval using one of
	the piecewise perturbation methods developed for the regular Schr{\"\i}¿½dinger
	problem.We select the truncation points using a procedure based on
	the WKB approximation. However for problems which behave as a Coulomb
	problem both around the origin and in the asymptotic range, a more
	accurate treatment of the numerical boundaries is possible. Taking
	into account the asymptotic form of the Coulomb equation, adapted
	boundary conditions can be constructed and as a consequence smaller
	truncation points can be chosen. To deal with the singularity of
	the Coulomb-like problem around the origin, a special perturbative
	algorithm is applied in a small interval around the origin.},

	Abstract = {Background: The nuclei in the region around 68Ni display an apparent
	rapid development of collectivity as protons are removed from the
	f7/2 single-particle state along the N=40 isotonic chain. Proton
	and neutron excitations across the Z=28 and N=40 gaps are observed
	in odd-A 27Co and 26Fe isotopes. Little spectroscopic information
	beyond the excited 2+ and 4+ is available in the even-even 2666,68Fe
	nuclei to compare with shell model calculations.
	
	
	Purpose: Our goal is to determine the low-energy level schemes of
	66,68Fe and compare the observed excitations with shell model calculations
	to identify states wherein a contribution from excitations across
	Z=28 and N=40 are present.
	
	
	Method: The low-energy states of 66,68Fe were populated through the
	beta decay of 66,68Mn produced at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
	Laboratory. Beta-delayed gamma-ray transitions were detected and
	correlated to the respective parent isotope to construct a low-energy
	level scheme.
	
	
	Results: The low-energy level schemes of 66,68Fe were constructed
	from observed gamma-ray coincidences and absolute gamma-ray intensities.
	Tentative spin and parity assignments were assigned based on comparisons
	with shell model calculations and systematics. The two lowest 0+
	and 2+ states were characterized in terms of the number of protons
	and neutrons excited across the respective shell gaps.
	
	
	Conclusion: The removal of two protons from 68Ni to 66Fe results in
	an inversion of the normal configuration and the one characterized
	by significant excitation across the Z=28 and N=40 gaps. Approximately,
	one proton and two neutrons are excited across their respective single-particle
	gaps in the ground state of 66Fe.},

	Abstract = {The self-consistent relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation
	(RQRPA) is extended by the quasiparticle-phonon coupling (QPC) model
	using the quasiparticle time blocking approximation (QTBA). The method
	is formulated in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the
	two-quasiparticle space with an energy-dependent two-quasiparticle
	residual interaction. This equation is solved either in the basis
	of Dirac states forming the self-consistent solution of the ground
	state or in the momentum representation. Pairing correlations are
	treated within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model with a monopole-monopole
	interaction. The same NL3 set of the coupling constants generates
	the Dirac-Hartree-BCS single-quasiparticle spectrum, the static part
	of the residual two-quasiparticle interaction and the quasiparticle-phonon
	coupling amplitudes. A quantitative description of electric dipole
	excitations in the chain of tin isotopes (Z=50) with the mass numbers
	A=100,106,114,116,120, and 130 and in the chain of isotones with
	(N=50) 88Sr, 90Zr, 92Mo is performed within this framework. The RQRPA
	extended by the coupling to collective vibrations generates spectra
	with a multitude of 2q⊗phonon (two quasiparticles plus phonon) states
	providing a noticeable fragmentation of the giant dipole resonance
	as well as of the soft dipole mode (pygmy resonance) in the nuclei
	under investigation. The results obtained for the photo absorption
	cross sections and for the integrated contributions of the low-lying

	Abstract = {A transformation to a moving frame (the Eckardt frame) is used to
	study the quantum states of interacting electrons in parabolic quantum
	dots in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The approach
	is motivated by examining ground-state pair-correlation functions
	obtained by exact diagonalization. The main results concern the physical
	nature of the electron states and the origin of magic numbers. Some
	of the states are found to be localized about a single minimum of
	the potential energy. They have well-defined symmetry and are physically
	analogous to molecules. They are treated approximately by antisymmetrizing
	Eckardt frame rotational-vibrational states. This approach leads
	to selection rules that predict all the magic angular momentum and
	spin combinations found in previous numerical work. In addition,
	it enables the ground-state energy and low-lying excitations of the
	molecular states to be calculated to high accuracy. Analytic results
	for three electrons agree very well with the results of exact diagonalization.
	States that are not localized about a single minimum are also studied.
	They do not have distinct spatial symmetry and occur only when selection
	rules and conservation laws allow tunneling between states localized
	on different minima. These states appear to be small system precursors

	Abstract = {The energy and structure of dilute hard- and soft-sphere Bose gases
	are systematically studied in the framework of several many-body
	approaches, such as the variational correlated theory, the Bogoliubov
	model, and the uniform limit approximation, valid in the weak-interaction
	regime. When possible, the results are compared with the exact diffusion
	Monte Carlo ones. Jastrow-type correlation provides a good description
	of the systems, both hard- and soft-spheres, if the hypernetted chain
	energy functional is freely minimized and the resulting Euler equation
	is solved. The study of the soft-sphere potentials confirms the appearance
	of a dependence of the energy on the shape of the potential at gas
	paremeter values of x?0.001. For quantities other than the energy,
	such as the radial distribution functions and the momentum distributions,
	the dependence appears at any value of x. The occurrence of a maximum
	in the radial distribution function, in the momentum distribution,
	and in the excitation spectrum is a natural effect of the correlations
	when x increases. The asymptotic behaviors of the functions characterizing
	the structure of the systems are also investigated. The uniform limit
	approach is very easy to implement and provides a good description

	Abstract = {We present a translationally invariant formulation of the no-core
	shell model approach for few-nucleon systems. We discuss a general
	method of antisymmetrization of the harmonic-oscillator (HO) basis
	depending on Jacobi coordinates. The use of a translationally invariant
	basis allows us to employ larger model spaces than in traditional
	shell-model calculations. Moreover, in addition to two-body effective
	interactions, three- or higher-body effective interactions as well
	as real three-body interactions can be utilized. In the present study
	we apply the formalism to solve three and four nucleon systems interacting
	by the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential in model spaces that
	include up to 34?? and 16?? HO excitations, respectively. Results
	of ground-state as well as excited-state energies, rms radii, and
	magnetic moments are discussed. In addition, we compare charge form
	factor results obtained using the CD-Bonn and Argonne V8? NN potentials.},

	Abstract = {roperties of finite nuclei are evaluated with two-nucleon (NN) and
	three-nucleon (NNN) interactions derived within chiral effective
	field theory. The nuclear Hamiltonian is fixed by properties of the
	A=2 system, except for two low-energy constants (LECs) that parametrize
	the short range NNN interaction, which we constrain with the A=3
	binding energies. We investigate the sensitivity of 4He, 6Li, 10,11B,
	and 12,13C properties to the variation of the constrained LECs. We
	identify observables that are sensitive to this variation and find
	preferred values that give the best overall description. We demonstrate
	that the NNN interaction terms significantly improve the binding
	energies and spectra of mid-p-shell nuclei not just with the preferred
	choice of the LECs but even within a wide range of the constrained
	LECs. We find that a very high quality description of these nuclei
	requires further improvements to the chiral Hamiltonian.},

	Abstract = {Although mechanical properties of DNA are well characterized at the
	kilobase-pair range, a number of recent experiments have suggested
	that DNA is more flexible at shorter length scales, which correspond
	to the regime that is crucial for cellular processes such as DNA
	packaging and gene regulation. Here, we perform a systematic study
	of the effective elastic properties of DNA at different length scales
	by probing the conformation and fluctuations of DNA from the single
	base-pair level up to four helical turns, using trajectories from
	atomistic simulation. We find evidence that supports cooperative
	softening of the stretch modulus and identify the essential modes
	that give rise to this effect. The bend correlation exhibits modulations
	that reflect the helical periodicity, while it yields a reasonable
	value for the effective persistence length, and the twist modulus
	undergoes a smooth crossover---from a relatively smaller value at the
	single base-pair level to the bulk value---over half a DNA turn.},

	Abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA?s) seek to improve upon the
	accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure
	calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space
	cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order
	gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found
	that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for
	a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate.
	(2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a
	statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and
	interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found
	for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1
	eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for
	the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there
	is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange
	and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock
	result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation
	of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3?4 % is corrected, and
	the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function,
	surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature
	energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison
	with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution,
	we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental
	or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand
	the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its
	physical effects.},

@article{perdew1981,
	Abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly
	self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact),
	but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD)
	approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two
	related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any
	density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent
	one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle.
	Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although
	the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle
	potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham
	scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly
	conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while
	substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this
	method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD
	approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements,
	qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction.
	Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values
	for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation
	pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which
	are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities,
	(iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal
	energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior
	of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy
	the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by
	numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the
	LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The
	LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies
	of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss
	the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a
	parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density,
	based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

	Abstract = {We present a new high performance configuration interaction code optimally
	designed for the calculation of the lowest-energy eigenstates of
	a few electrons in semiconductor quantum dots (also called artificial
	atoms) in the strong interaction regime. The implementation relies
	on a single-particle representation, but it is independent of the
	choice of the single-particle basis and, therefore, of the details
	of the device and configuration of external fields. Assuming no truncation
	of the Fock space of Slater determinants generated from the chosen
	single-particle basis, the code may tackle regimes where Coulomb
	interaction very effectively mixes many determinants. Typical strongly
	correlated systems lead to very large diagonalization problems; in
	our implementation, the secular equation is reduced to its minimal
	rank by exploiting the symmetry of the effective-mass interacting
	Hamiltonian, including square total spin. The resulting Hamiltonian
	is diagonalized via parallel implementation of the Lanczos algorithm.
	The code gives access to both wave functions and energies of first
	excited states. Excellent code scalability in a parallel environment
	is demonstrated; accuracy is tested for the case of up to eight electrons
	confined in a two-dimensional harmonic trap as the density is progressively
	diluted up to the Wigner regime, where correlations become dominant.
	Comparison with previous quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the Wigner
	regime demonstrates power and flexibility of the method. (c) 2006

	by means of many-body perturbation theory. Only the physically relevant
	states of the no-core model space are considered, which leads to
	a dramatic reduction of the basis dimension. We analyze the validity

	converged calculations for the ground state of 40Ca within no-core

	Abstract = {We employ correlated realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions for the
	description of nuclear ground states throughout the nuclear chart
	within the Hartree-Fock approximation. The crucial short-range central
	and tensor correlations, which are induced by the realistic interaction
	and cannot be described by the Hartree-Fock many-body state itself,
	are included explicitly by a state-independent unitary transformation
	in the framework of the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM).
	Using the correlated realistic interaction VUCOM resulting from the
	Argonne V18 potential, bound nuclei are already obtained on the Hartree-Fock
	level. However, the binding energies are smaller than the experimental
	values because long-range correlations have not been accounted for.
	Their inclusion by means of many-body perturbation theory leads to
	a remarkable agreement with experimental binding energies over the
	whole mass range from 4He to 208Pb, even far off the valley of stability.
	The observed perturbative character of the residual long-range correlations

	Abstract = {The Bose-Einstein condensation in trapped gases of 85Rb at densities
	beyond the dilute regime can now be realized taking advantage of
	Feshbach resonances. The gas density may be characterized by the
	parameter na3, where n=N/V is the number density and a is the scattering
	length which is tuned using Feshbach resonance. We explore the properties
	of interacting trapped bosons in the density range 5×10-3<~na3<~5×10-2
	using Monte Carlo methods to compare with experiments. We find that
	there is a significant depletion of the condensate at T=0 K, for
	example, 25% at na3=10-2. The condensate is not concentrated at the
	center of the trap but is spread out over four or five trap lengths.
	The condensate density distributions and the total density distributions
	within the trap are very similar and the condensate fraction is 100%
	at the edges of the trap.},

	Abstract = {Using the finite simulation-cell homogeneous electron gas (HEG) as

	wave-function expansions. Simple analytic and numerical results from

	basis-set incompleteness error where M is the number of plane waves
	used in the calculation, allowing for straightforward extrapolation
	to the CBS limit. As we shall show, the choice of basis-set truncation
	when constructing many-electron wave functions is far from obvious,
	and here we propose several alternatives based on the momentum transfer
	vector, which greatly improve the rate of convergence. This is demonstrated
	for a variety of wave-function methods, from MP2 to coupled-cluster
	doubles theory and the random-phase approximation plus second-order
	screened exchange. Finite basis-set energies are presented for these
	methods and compared with exact benchmarks. A transformation can
	map the orbitals of a general solid state system onto the HEG plane-wave
	basis and thereby allow application of these methods to more realistic

	and discuss its efficient implementation in the PSI3 program package.
	The program is streamlined to use at most [script O](N7) computational
	steps and avoids storage of the triple-excitation amplitudes for
	both the ground- and excited-state calculations. The excitation-energy
	program makes use of a L{\"o}wdin projection formalism (comparable to
	that of earlier implementations) that allows computational reduction
	of the Davidson algorithm to only the single- and double-excitation
	space, but limits the calculation to only one excited state at a
	time. However, a root-following algorithm may be used to compute
	energies for multiple states of the same symmetry. Benchmark applications
	of the new methods to the lowest valence 2B1 state of the allyl radical,
	low-lying states of the CH and CO+ diatomics, and the nitromethyl
	radical show substantial improvement over ROHF- and UHF-based CCSD
	excitation energies for states with strong double-excitation character
	or cases suffering from significant spin contamination. For the allyl
	radical, CC3 adiabatic excitation energies differ from experiment
	by less than 0.02 eV, while for the 2Sigma+ state of CH, significant
	errors of more than 0.4 eV remain.},

	Abstract = {In this Letter, we report a new mass for 11Li using the trapping experiment
	TITAN at TRIUMF's ISAC facility. This is by far the shortest-lived
	nuclide, t1/2=8.8 ms, for which a mass measurement has ever been
	performed with a Penning trap. Combined with our mass measurements
	of 8,9Li we derive a new two-neutron separation energy of 369.15(65)
	keV: a factor of 7 more precise than the best previous value. This
	new value is a critical ingredient for the determination of the halo
	charge radius from isotope-shift measurements. We also report results
	from state-of-the-art atomic-physics calculations using the new mass
	and extract a new charge radius for 11Li. This result is a remarkable
	confluence of nuclear and atomic physics.},

	properties. For symmetric matter the spectral function is broadened
	at all momenta and all densities, while an opposite effect is found
	for the case of neutrons only. Noticeable modification of the spectral

	Abstract = {Recently developed quantum algorithms suggest that quantum computers
	can solve certain problems and perform certain tasks more efficiently
	than conventional computers. Among other reasons, this is due to
	the possibility of creating non-classical correlations, or quantum
	entanglement, which is a phenomena hard or impossible to reproduce
	by classical-information methods.
	
	In this thesis I first investigate the simulation of quantum systems
	on a quantum computer constructed of two-level quantum elements or
	qubits. For this purpose, I present algebra mappings that allow one
	to obtain physical properties and compute correlation functions of
	fermionic, anyonic, and bosonic systems with such a computer. The
	results obtained show that the complexity of preparing a quantum
	state which contains the desired information for the computation
	is crucial.
	
	Second, I present a wide class of quantum computations, which could
	involve entangled states, that can be simulated with the same efficiency
	on both types of computers. The notion of generalized quantum entanglement
	then naturally emerges. This generalization of entanglement is based
	on the idea that entanglement is an observer-dependent concept, that
	is, relative to a set of preferred observables.},

	lowest-energy three-fermion states away from the unitary limit and
	find a possible inversion of parity in the ground state in the limit
	of trap size large compared to the scattering length. Furthermore,
	we investigate the lowest positive-parity states for four fermions,
	although we are limited by the dimensions we can currently handle

	Abstract = {Introducing a new vertex function, {\^Z}(E), of an energy variable E,
	we derive a new equation for the effective interaction. The equation
	is obtained by replacing the Q̂ box in the Krenciglowa-Kuo (KK) method
	with {\^Z}(E). This new approach can be viewed as an extension of the
	KK method. We show that this equation can be solved both in iterative
	and noniterative ways. We observe that the iteration procedure with
	{\^Z}(E) brings about fast convergence compared to the usual KK method.
	It is shown that, as in the KK approach, the procedure of calculating
	the effective interaction can be reduced to determining the true
	eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian H and they can be obtained
	as the positions of intersections of graphs generated from {\^Z}(E).
	We find that this graphical method yields always precise results
	and reproduces any of the true eigenvalues of H. The calculation
	in the present approach can be made regardless of overlaps with the
	model space and energy differences between unperturbed energies and
	the eigenvalues of H. We find also that {\^Z}(E) is a well-behaved function
	of E and has no singularity. These characteristics of the present
	approach ensure stability in actual calculations and would be helpful
	to resolve some difficulties due to the presence of poles in the
	Q̂ box. Performing test calculations, we verify numerically theoretical
	predictions made in the present approach.},

	Abstract = {The Schr{\"o}dinger equation for quantum-dot lattices with noncubic, non-Bravais
	lattices built up from elliptical dots is investigated. The Coulomb
	interaction between the dots is considered in dipole approximation.
	Then only the center of mass (c.m.) coordinates of different dots
	couple with each other. This c.m. subsystem can be solved exactly
	and provides magnetophononlike collective excitations. The interdot
	interaction is involved only through a single interaction parameter.
	The relative coordinates of individual dots form decoupled subsystems
	giving rise to intradot excitation modes. As an example, the latter
	are calculated exactly for two-electron dots. Emphasis is layed on
	qualitative effects, like: (i) Influence of the magnetic field on
	the lattice instability due to interdot interaction; (ii) closing
	of the gap between the lower and the upper c.m. mode at B=0 for elliptical
	dots due to dot interaction; and (iii) Kinks in the intradot excitation
	energies (versus magnetic field) due to change of ground-state angular
	momentum. It is shown that for obtaining striking qualitative effects
	one should go beyond simple cubic lattices with circular dots. In
	particular, for observing effects of electron-electron interaction
	between the dots in far-infrared spectra (breaking Kohn?s Theorem)
	one has to consider dot lattices with at least two dot species with

	Here, we develop an architecture for quantum computation using electrically

	Abstract = {The Lieb formulation of density-functional theory is briefly reviewed
	and its straightforward generalization to arbitrary electron-electron
	interaction strengths discussed, leading to the introduction of density-fixed
	and potential-fixed adiabatic connections. An iterative scheme for
	the calculation of the Lieb functionals under the appropriate constraints
	is outlined following the direct optimization approach of Wu and
	Yang [J. Chem. Phys. 118, 2498 (2003)]. First- and second-order optimization
	schemes for the calculation of accurate adiabatic-connection integrands
	are investigated and compared; the latter is preferred both in terms
	of computational efficiency and accuracy. The scheme is applicable
	to systems of any number of electrons. However, to determine the
	accuracy that may be achieved, the present work focuses on two-electron
	systems for which a number of simplifications may be exploited. The
	procedure is applied to the helium isoelectronic series and the H2
	molecule. The resulting adiabatic-connection curves yield the full
	configuration-interaction exchange-correlation energies extrapolated
	to the basis-set limit. The relationship between the Kohn?Sham and
	natural orbitals as functions of the electron-electron interaction
	strength is explored in detail for H2. The accuracy with which the
	exchange-correlation contributions to the modified local potential
	can be determined is discussed. The new accurate adiabatic-connection
	curves are then compared with some recently investigated approximate
	forms calculated using accurate full configuration-interaction input
	data. This study demonstrates that the adiabatic-connection integrand
	may be determined accurately and efficiently, providing important
	insights into the link between the Kohn?Sham and traditional quantum-chemical

	Abstract = {Background: The experimental study of g(I>2) factors of nuclear states
	can provide information about the evolution of collectivity in certain
	regions of the nuclear chart, and assist in obtaining a microscopic
	description of the nuclear wave functions. The measurements and explanations
	of g(I>2) factors are still a challenge for experiments and theory.
	
	
	Purpose: Measurement of the g(21+) and g(41+) factors, the latter
	for the first time, in the 4496Ru nucleus. Comparison of the experimental
	results with calculations using the shell model and collective models.
	
	
	Methods: The experiments made use of the transient field technique,
	using a Coulomb-excitation reaction in inverse kinematics. Large
	scale shell model calculations were performed; comparisons with previous
	theoretical predictions, using the tidal-wave model and the hydrodynamical
	model, were carried out.
	
	
	Results: The values of g(21+)=+0.46(2) and g(41+)=+0.58(8) were experimentally
	obtained. While the g(21+) value agrees with the hydrodynamical model
	prediction of g=Z/A=+0.46, the g(41+) is in agreement with the shell
	model predictions. The trend of the experimental g factors, as a
	function of nuclear spin, is not reproduced by the theoretical models
	discussed.
	
	
	Conclusions: Measurements of g(21+) and g(41+) in 96Ru were performed.
	Further theoretical efforts are necessary to explain the trend of
	the g factors as a function of nuclear spin for the 96Ru nucleus.
	Future measurements of g(41+) should reduce the uncertainty of the
	result.},

	Abstract = {We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy
	minimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton,
	linear, and perturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter
	variations are calculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using
	a reduced variance statistical estimator for the latter. In the linear
	method, the parameter variations are found by diagonalizing a nonsymmetric
	estimator of the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave
	function and its derivatives with respect to the parameters, making
	use of a strong zero-variance principle. In the less computationally
	expensive perturbative method, the parameter variations are calculated
	by approximately solving the generalized eigenvalue equation of the
	linear method by a nonorthogonal perturbation theory. These general
	methods are illustrated here by the optimization of wave functions
	consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an expansion in configuration
	state functions (CSFs) for the C2 molecule, including both valence
	and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and linear methods
	are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF, and
	orbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative
	for the optimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although
	the optimization is performed at the variational Monte Carlo level,
	we observe for the C2 molecule studied here, and for other systems
	we have studied, that as more parameters in the trial wave functions

	nearly 2p-2h intruder configuration, thus extending the ?island of

@article{trofimov:144115,
	Abstract = {An earlier proposed propagator method for the treatment of molecular
	ionization is tested in first applications. The method referred to
	as the non-Dyson third-order algebraic-diagrammatic construction
	[nD-ADC(3)] approximation for the electron propagator represents
	a computationally promising alternative to the existing Dyson ADC(3)
	method. The advantage of the nD-ADC(3) scheme is that the (N$\pm$1)-electronic
	parts of the one-particle Green's function are decoupled from each
	other and the corresponding equations can be solved separately. For
	a test of the method the nD-ADC(3) results for the vertical ionization
	transitions in C2H4, CO, CS, F2, H2CO, H2O, HF, N2, and Ne are compared
	with available experimental and theoretical data including results
	of full configuration interaction (FCI) and coupled cluster computations.
	The mean error of the nD-ADC(3) ionization energies relative to the
	experimental and FCI results is about 0.2 eV. The nD-ADC(3) method,
	scaling as n5 with the number of orbitals, requires the solution
	of a relatively simple Hermitian eigenvalue problem. The method renders
	access to ground-state properties such as dipole moments. Moreover,
	also one-electron properties of (N$\pm$1) electron states can now be
	studied as a consequence of a specific intermediate-state representation
	(ISR) formulation of the nD-ADC approach. Corresponding second-order
	ISR equations are presented.},

	Abstract = {In this work we analyze the tensor-force component of effective interactions
	appropriate for nuclear shell-model studies, with particular emphasis
	on the monopole term of the interactions. Standard nucleon-nucleon
	(NN) interactions such as AV8' and χN3LO are tailored to shell-model
	studies by employing Vlowk techniques to handle the short-range repulsion
	of the NN interactions and by applying many-body perturbation theory
	to incorporate in-medium effects. We show, via numerical studies
	of effective interactions for the sd and the pf shells, that the
	tensor-force contribution to the monopole term of the effective interaction
	is barely changed by these renormalization procedures, resulting
	in almost the same monopole term as the one of the bare NN interactions.
	We propose to call this feature renormalization persistency of the
	tensor force, as it is a remarkable property of the renormalization
	and should have many interesting consequences in nuclear systems.
	For higher multipole terms, this feature is maintained to a somewhat
	smaller extent. We present general intuitive explanations for the
	renormalization persistency of the tensor force as well as analyses
	of core-polarization terms in perturbation theory. The central force
	does not exhibit a similar renormalization persistency.},

	discovery that neutrinos are massive particles, which has implications
	from high-energy physics to cosmology. A new method for the production
	of intense and pure neutrino beams has been proposed recently: the

	beta-decay. This novel concept has been the starting point for a
	possible new future facility. Its main goal is to address the crucial
	issue of the existence of CP violation in the lepton sector. Here
	we review the status and the recent developments of beta-beams. We
	discuss the original, the medium and high-energy scenarios as well
	as mono-chromatic neutrino beams produced through ion electron-capture.
	The issue of the degeneracies is mentioned. An overview of low energy
	beta-beams is also presented. These beams can be used to perform

	space connecting the 0p and 1s0d shells with due regard for the perturbative
	effects of the neighboring 0s and 0f1p shells. The interactions have
	three distinctive 0p-shell, cross-shell, and 1s0d-shell parts. The
	latter is taken to be the previously determined W interaction. The
	0p-shell interaction is represented by two-body matrix elements and
	the cross-shell by either a potential or by two-body matrix elements.
	The interactions are determined by least-squares fits to 51 0p-shell
	and 165 cross-shell binding energies. It is found that the addition
	of monopole terms to a potential that is otherwise similar to that
	of the Millener-Kurath interaction results in a great improvement
	in the fit. In the fit to two-body matrix elements, 45 of 97 possible
	linear combinations of parameters are varied and the root-mean-square
	deviation for the 165 cross-shell energies is 330 keV. Examples of

	this potential term has a crucial effect on the existence and structure
	of baby multi-skyrmions. The simplest holomorphic baby Skyrme model
	has no known stable minimal-energy solution for n greater than one.
	The other baby Skyrme model studied in the literature possesses non-radially

	Abstract = {Nuclear interactions evolved via renormalization group methods to
	lower resolution become increasingly nonlocal (off-diagonal in coordinate
	space) as they are softened. This inhibits both the development of
	intuition about the interactions and their use with some methods
	for solving the quantum many-body problem. By applying ``local projections'',
	a softened interaction can be reduced to a local effective interaction
	plus a nonlocal residual interaction. At the two-body level, a local
	projection after similarity renormalization group (SRG) evolution
	manifests the elimination of short-range repulsive cores and the
	flow toward universal low-momentum interactions. The SRG residual
	interaction is found to be relatively weak at low energy, which motivates
	a perturbative treatment.},

	Abstract = {A direct optimization method is developed for the computation of the
	Kohn?Sham kinetic energy density functional Ts from a given electron
	density and the exchange?correlation potential vxc if this density
	is from a ground state. The method is based on the construction of
	a variational functional of the one-electron potential. This functional
	is derived from the conventional Levy constrained-search formulation
	and is shown to be closely related to the Lieb functional construction.
	The one-electron potential is expanded in terms of some fixed terms
	plus a linear expansion in a basis set. The determination of the
	Kohn?Sham kinetic energy for an input density is then turned into
	the maximization of this functional of potential. The analytic first
	and second derivatives of the variational functional with respect
	to the linear basis set expansion coefficients and also the nonlinear
	parameters in the basis set are derived. This enables very efficient
	iterative optimization of the potential and hence the calculation
	of Ts and vxc. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is shown
	in the numerical implementation for atomic and molecular calculations
	with Gaussian basis set expansions both for molecular orbitals and
	for one-electron potentials. Finally, this direct optimization method
	is extended to general density functionals and the analytic derivatives
	are also developed for use in optimization methods.},

	Abstract = {Investigations of emergent symmetry breaking phenomena occurring in
	small finite-size systems are reviewed, with a focus on the strongly
	correlated regime of electrons in two-dimensional semiconductor quantum
	dots and trapped ultracold bosonic atoms in harmonic traps. Throughout
	the review we emphasize universal aspects and similarities of symmetry
	breaking found in these systems, as well as in more traditional fields
	like nuclear physics and quantum chemistry, which are characterized
	by very different interparticle forces. A unified description of
	strongly correlated phenomena in finite systems of repelling particles
	(whether fermions or bosons) is presented through the development
	of a two-step method of symmetry breaking at the unrestricted Hartree-Fock
	level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via post Hartree-Fock
	projection techniques. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
	two-step method are treated and validated by exact diagonalization
	calculations.Strongly-correlated phenomena emerging from symmetry
	breaking include the following. Chemical bonding, dissociation and
	entanglement (at zero and finite magnetic fields) in quantum dot
	molecules and in pinned electron molecular dimers formed within a
	single anisotropic quantum dot, with potential technological applications
	to solid-state quantum-computing devices. Electron crystallization,
	with particle localization on the vertices of concentric polygonal
	rings, and formation of rotating electron molecules (REMs) in circular
	quantum dots. Such electron molecules exhibit ro-vibrational excitation
	spectra, in analogy with natural molecules. At high magnetic fields,
	the REMs are described by parameter-free analytic wave functions,
	which are an alternative to the Laughlin and composite-fermion approaches,
	offering a new point of view of the fractional quantum Hall regime
	in quantum dots (with possible implications for the thermodynamic
	limit). Crystalline phases of strongly repelling bosons. In rotating
	traps and in analogy with the REMs, such repelling bosons form rotating
	boson molecules (RBMs). For a small number of bosons, the RBMs are
	energetically favored compared with the Gross-Pitaevskii solutions
	describing vortex formation. We discuss the present status concerning
	experimental signatures of such strongly correlated states, in view
	of the promising outlook created by the latest experimental improvements
	that are achieving unprecedented control over the range and strength
	of interparticle interactions.},
